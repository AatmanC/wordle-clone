        - This game is a brain wracking and a really fun game in which you have to guess a 5 letter word in 6 guesses and that 5 letter word is refreshed everyday.
        <br>
        - Yellow colour signifies the correct letter but it is at the wrong place.
        <br>
        - Green colour signifies the correct letter and also that it is at the right place
        <br>
        - Black colour signifies the wrong letter and means that, that particular letter is not there in the final word.
